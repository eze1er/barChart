# barChart
My Bar Chart project in Lighthouse work preparation for the bootcamp 
This project will consist of building a library that will allow other developers to generate bar charts on their web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'll also be using jQuery to access and manipulate the DOM in order to draw the charts.
